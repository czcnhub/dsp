# Data Submission Portal Backend
The Data Submission Portal is a website that provides recommendations, best practices, and supports submitting research data and other products to multiple Earth Science Data repositories. 

## Getting Started

*These instructions assume Docker and docker-compose are installed.

#### Run dspback with a development image

```commandline
make up
```

Access the OpenAPI docs at http://0.0.0.0:5002/redoc

#### Run the full stack (with dspfront)
A make command exists for building the dspfront image.  It temporarily clones the repository with the default branch and builds the image for you.

```commandline
make build-dspfront
```

Run the full stack (The dspfront image is a prerequisite and currently must be built from source)

```commandline
make up-all
```

Access the application at https://localhost/

These instructions built with the following versions:
```
Docker version 20.10.11, build dea9396
docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 5becea4c
```

## Development
TODO: Explain make commands available for building, configuration, adding new repositories and outline of the current architecture
